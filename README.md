# Efficient Bound of Lipschitz Constant for Convolutional Layers by Gram Iteration

This repository contains the code for the paper
[Efficient Bound of Lipschitz Constant for Convolutional Layers by Gram Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16173)
published at ICML 2023 by Blaise Delattre, [Quentin Barth√©lemy](https://github.com/qbarthelemy), [Alexandre Araujo](https://github.com/araujoalexandre) and Alexandre Allauzen.


Gram iteration is a deterministic method to compute spectral norm in super linear convergence.
It exhibits SOTA results on GPU regarding spectral norm computations.

## This repository

### Outline
* `bounds.py` contains code for different spectral norm bounds. 

* `note_book_test_gram_iteration.ipynb` contains some examples of spectral norm bound computations for different methods on dense and convolutional layers.

* `train_local.py` contains code to launch a training. Start a default configuration run  `python train_local.py --bound delattre2023 --bound_n_iter 6 --lr 0.1 --r 0.1`
