# Efficient Bound of Lipschitz Constant for Convolutional Layers by Gram Iteration

This repository contains the code for the paper [Efficient Bound of Lipschitz Constant for Convolutional Layers by Gram Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16173) by Blaise Delattre, Quentin Barthélemy, Alexandre Araujo and Alexandre Allauzen.

Gram iteration is a deterministic method to compute spectral norm in super linear convergence. It exhibits SOTA results on GPU regarding spectral norm computations.

## This repository

### Outline
* `bounds.py` contains code for different spectral norm bounds. 

* `note_book_test_gram_iteration.ipynb` contains some examples of spectral norm bound computations for different methods on dense and convolutional layers.

* `train_local.py` contains code to launch a training. Start a default configuration run  `python train_local.py --bound ours_backward --bound_n_iter 6 --lr 0.1 --r 0.1`
